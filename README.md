# NLA_team13: Analyzing the Evolution of Weight Matrices in the OPT-13B LLM During Training

Our idea is to take the weights of a certain LLM, for example, OPT-13B (https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/tree/main/projects/OPT), as well as the weights of all training checkpoints. 

All weights are represented in matrix form, so we will be interested in the matrices of Key, Query, Value, Output Projection from attention, the tokens embedding matrix, and the two weight matrices for each layer of the Feedforward Neural Network (FFN). 

Next, we will analyze how the characteristics of these matrices change during the training process: 
1) We will examine and analyze their spectrum.
2) We will investigate how orthogonal the matrices are.
3) We will look at how much these matrices change during training (how far they are from their initialized values).
4) It would be interesting to check how correlated the rows of W1 and the columns of W2 in the FFN matrices are (there is a hypothesis that they should be).
5) We will evaluate how sparse all these matrices are.
6) We will analyze how various matrix norms change.
7) And more.

P.S. If we can find checkpoints of the model at the stages of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it will be even more interesting to see what happens with these characteristics at those stages.
